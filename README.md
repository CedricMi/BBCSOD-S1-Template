# Presonus Studio One template for the BBC Symphonic Orchestra - Discover Edition virtual instrument
#OneOrchestra
This template is saved as a [song for customization](https://github.com/CedricMi/BBCSOD-S1-Template/blob/master/BBC%20SO%20Discover%20Template.song), and as a [template for immediate use](https://github.com/CedricMi/BBCSOD-S1-Template/blob/master/BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra%20Discover%20Templates%20for%20Studio%20One%204.zip), one saved in the correct folder (Your main Studio One content folder/templates/v4):

adjust it to taste, then save it as a template in Studio One.
You can then create new songs by selecting this template in the User templates.
For example, by default all instrument tracks accept inputs from all midi devices. You might want to restrict this to your standard keyboard.

There is a folder for each orchestral section, with subfolders for each instrument.
There is a track for each articulation of each instrument.
All tracks are sent to the Stereo Mix bus, which goes to the main output.
The bus is preconfigured with 2 standard Studio One (SO) plugins: VU Meter and a limiter.

There are two FX channels: Verb 1, with the simple reverb MixVerb, and Verb 2 with the convolution reverb Open Air.
Each instrument track is sent to both FX channels at about -12 dB.
Adjust to taste: enable or disable the FX channels, change their parameters or plugins, enable or disable the sends, or change the send volume.

A simpflified version with no folder structure and only one track per instrument is also [available as a song](https://github.com/CedricMi/BBCSOD-S1-Template/blob/master/BBC%20SO%20Discover%20Simple%20Template.song) as well as a template - already included in the zip archive above.

Stay tuned for a video explaining these templates.
